## Notes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Wall placement preview + WASD shift + turn rotate; “enter/change” confirm flow
- 4‑player Quoridor mode with colored pawns (RED/BLUE/GREEN/PINK) and cyclic turns
- Robust wall legality: no overlap, no crossing, and guaranteed path for every player via BFS
- Wall conflict checks based on blocked edge flags to precisely prevent same‑orientation overlaps without forbidding valid endpoints
- Game classes only handle interaction; Board classes focus on rules/state
- Strong input user experience with range checking and safe parsing loops

## How to compile and run

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unzip the `CASCS_611_Quoridor.zip` file and run the following command:

```bash
cd `CASCS_611_Quoridor
mkdir out
javac -d out $(find app dots game puzzle quoridor -name "*.java")
java -cp out app.Main
```

## Input/Output Example

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the markdown file cannot show the right color, it will hard to figure out the players. But in terminal, we present players in different colors.

### Start to play

```bash
(base) awsomeone@jxx Downloads % cd CASCS_611_Quoridor
(base) awsomeone@jxx CASCS_611_Quoridor % mkdir out
(base) awsomeone@jxx CASCS_611_Quoridor % javac -d out $(find app dots game puzzle quoridor -name "*.java")
(base) awsomeone@jxx CASCS_611_Quoridor % java -cp out app.Main
=== Game Hub ===
1) Sliding Puzzle
2) Dots & Boxes
3) Quoridor
0) Quit
> 3
Quoridor mode:
1) 2 Players
2) 4 Players
> 1

=== Quoridor ===
Goal: be the first to reach the opposite edge.
Commands: type 'move' to relocate your pawn, or 'place' to position a wall.
Moves require selecting a destination (row col) followed by 'enter'. For walls, use WASD to shift, 'turn' to rotate, 'enter' to confirm, 'change' to re-choose.
